A movies recommender system


## Objective

The objective of this project is to propose a recommender system for movies, based on user subjective preferences and age

It must allow :
* Creation of multiple user profiles 
* Specification of users' prefered and most hated movies, age, and friendship relations with other users
* Suggestion of related movies using social relationships with other people and movies similarity based on 
external information, _e.g._, from http://www.allocine.fr/
